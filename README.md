# 🔥 viewr — Heatmap Visualization Tool

**`viewr`** is a lightweight and customizable heatmap viewer designed for fast and flexible visualization of matrix-style data (e.g., model outputs, attention maps, tabular numerical data).  
Originally developed as a research tool, `viewr` supports label toggling, color scheme customization, dynamic scaling, and more — all in a friendly CLI interface.

## 📦 Features

- 📊 Displays heatmaps from space-separated integer matrix files (e.g. `heatmap.txt`)
- 🎨 Choose from 15+ colormaps, including a custom *warm-rainbow* palette
- 🧠 Optionally show cell labels, with automatic color contrast
- 🧮 Smart grid layout that adapts to data size and label visibility
- 📈 Optional normalization or log-scaling (coming soon)
- 🖼 Export high-quality `.png` images
- 💻 Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (see usage below)

---

## 🖥️ Setup

### 🔹 Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
````

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Prepare your data

Example `heatmap.txt`:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

### 2. Run the program

#### 🔸 On Linux / macOS:

```bash
chmod +x viewr.sh
./viewr.sh
```

#### 🔹 On Windows:

Double-click `viewr.bat`
*or* run from Command Prompt:

```cmd
viewr.bat
```

## 🧾 Options (prompted during runtime)

* **Input file** – file containing the matrix (space-separated integers)
* **Label grid? (y/n)** – whether to annotate each cell with its value
* **Colormap** – choose from one of the following:

```
viridis, plasma, inferno, magma, cividis, Blues, Greens, Reds, Purples,
Spectral, coolwarm, seismic, ocean, terrain, hasitakv (custom warm-rainbow)
```

* **Save file as** – export the figure as a `.png` (or leave blank to skip saving)

## 🎨 Custom Colormap: `hasitakv`

A smooth rainbow-like temperature map with **yellow → orange → red**, ideal for heat-style intensity maps, inspired by researcher feedback.

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Can I use float values?**
A: Not yet, but support for floats and custom formats is planned.

**Q: How do I disable all labels and borders?**
A: When prompted: `Label grid? (y/n)` → `n`

**Q: It says matplotlib not found?**
A: Install it using `pip install matplotlib numpy`
